React To-Do List App

This is my Week 2 Assignment for the React learning module. It is  a fully functional To-Do List built using React. It includes features like task creation, deletion, completion marking, filtering, input validation, and localStorage persistence.
I took the reference from the youtube video provided and made my version of a to-do list app

Usage Instructions
Type your task into the input box and click Add Task
Click a task to mark it completed
Click the X button to delete a task
Use the filter buttons to change between All, Completed & Incomplete tasks
Refresh the page and all your tasks will be saved in the localStorage
